# Crawler
Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts.

This is a program written in Processing. This program randomly selects a point and starts a random number of "crawlers"(not some technical term. just came up with it). 
Program does plots out an image in a weird way. 

Maybe the video will help you understand :)
